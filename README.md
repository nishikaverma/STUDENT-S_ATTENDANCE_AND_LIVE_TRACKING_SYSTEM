​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​STUDENT ATTENDANCE SYSTEM AND  LIVE TRACKING ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​​​​TECHNOLOGY USED ​​​​

The system is implemented using Python Programming Language.
​It makes use of :
  ​Face Detection 
  ​Face Recognition

with the help of Python's libraries such as :
​CV2 : An openCV library for Image processing .
​NUMPY : For computing, processing and performing various  operations on arrays (as an image is an array of pixels values) .
​MATPLOTLIB, PIL : for capturing, opening and saving the image  set as a file.
​Tkinter : for making the graphical user interface of the application.
​CSV : for storing attedance data in a CSV file formate.
​OS : for performing operations over system paths .
​re, datetime  : for other internal computations.

​​​​​SYSTEM FLOW CONTROL ​​​​​​
​ The system is built upon MVC design  architecture

​   model.py ------------>  controller.py  -----------> views.py   ​

​model.py :  It manages all the updations and maintainance (attendance marking, attendanec file creation, etc.) of CSV files.  

​controller.py :  It takes all the event requests from "views.py" , process it, and sends the response back .Also forwards the requests to model.py, if required, accepts & transfers the  response back to views.py .

​views.py : Contains all the GUI (Front end) of app. Takes all the requests.

​​​​​​​ALGORITHM ​​​​​​​​​
1. Object(face) tracking on the video (face detection +tracking)
2. Capturing  face samples and storing it.
3.  Creating and training face detection "model"  (.yml file)
4.  Face detection  + Face recognization
5.  Attendance marking (csv file updation)

​ Face Detection : 

HARCASCADE CLASSIFIERS (which internally uses "FEATURE MATCHING algo") is used for face detection.
By passing 'cascade'(series) of 'classifiers' ('predefined features' which are nothing but group of arrays of 'float values' i.e. a matrix, denoting the grey color point  of an image.​
As, an image is nothing but  a matrix of floating point numbers.

​Face Recognization :

LBPH recognization algorithm is used for facial recognization
It  compares the input facial image with all facial images existing inside the dataset, with the aim to find the image that best matches that face.
It is basically a 1xN comparison.
